# Linear Regression : Overview
In this project i used data from [Kaggle](https://github.com/denidya/linear-regression/blob/main/Ecommerce%20Customers) and doing little exploration data analysis to see correlation between feature.

## Codes & Resources Used
- Editor Used : VS Code
- Python version : 3.8.8
- Package used : numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- sklearn
